# Compass

[中文文档](README_zh.md)

Compass is a big data task diagnosis platform, which aims to improve the efficiency of user troubleshooting and reduce
the cost of abnormal tasks for users.

The key features:

- Non-invasive, instant diagnosis, you can experience the diagnostic effect without modifying the existing scheduling
  platform.

- Supports multiple scheduling platforms(DolphinScheduler 2.x or 3.x, Airflow, or self-developed etc.)

- Supports Spark 2.x or 3.x, Hadoop 2.x or 3.x troubleshooting.

- Supports workflow layer exception diagnosis, identifies various failures and baseline time-consuming abnormal
  problems.

- Supports Spark engine layer exception diagnosis, including 14 types of exceptions such as data skew, large table scanning,
  and memory waste.

- Supports various log matching rule writing and abnormal threshold adjustment, and can be optimized according to actual
  scenarios.

Compass has supported the concept of diagnostic types:

     <tr>
         <td>Diagnostic Dimensions</td>
         <td>Diagnostic Type</td>
         <td>Type Description</td>

## Get Started

Use JDK 8 and maven 3.6.0+ to Compile

### 1. Compile

```
git clone https://github.com/cubefs/compass.git

  yarn:
    - clusterName: "bigdata"
      resourceManager: [ "machine1:8088", "machine2:8088" ] # the value of yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address
      jobHistoryServer: "machine3:19888" # the value of mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.address

  spark:
    sparkHistoryServer: [ "machine4:18080" ] # the value of spark.history.ui

```

### 3. Initialize the database and tables

The Compass table structure consists of two parts, one is compass.sql, and the other is a table that depends on the scheduling platform (dolphinscheduler.sql or airflow.sql, etc.)

1. Please execute document/sql/compass.sql first

2. If you are using the DolphinScheduler scheduling platform, please execute document/sql/dolphinscheduler.sql(It needs to be modified according to the actual version used); if you are using the Airflow scheduling platform, please execute document/sql/airflow.sql(It needs to be modified according to the actual version used)

3. If you are using a self-developed scheduling platform, please refer to the [task-syncer](document/manual/deployment.md#task-syncer) module to determine the tables that need to be synchronized

### 4. Deploy

```
./bin/start_all.sh
```
